# CronCleanupScript


For Azure Automation, you can then create a new Runbook in the Azure Portal, copy and paste the given PowerShell script into the Runbook editor, and publish it. 

You can also schedule the Runbook to run at specific intervals using the Azure Automation schedule.

Also, you need to ensure that the Azure Automation Runbook environment has the necessary permissions to access and modify the cleanup directory.

Replace  "C:\Path\To\Your\Directory" and "C:\Path\To\Your\LogFile.log" with the actual paths you want.
